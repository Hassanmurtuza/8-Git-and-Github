There are several steps in git to start in CMD 
                    Working Directory 
1) > git init (to initalize the git repository in this folder.)
    > ls -a (check the hidden files)
2) > git status (to check the status of the repository.)

                    Staging Area:
3) > git add file.name (to add a particular file in a staging area)
    > git add . (by using "." it means add all the files present in this particular directory)

                     Local Repository:
4) > git commit -m "Comment on this particular commit" (to commit the changes in the repository a safe point) 
5) > git log (check all the commit history of the repository)
6) > git checkout File.name (rolleback to a previous commit)
7) > git diff File.name (shows the changes made in a particular file before commiting used to check)

                    Remote Repository:
8) > git remote add <name> <url_repository> 
    > git remote add origin http://hassanmurtuza5@gmail.com
9) > git push -u <remote name> <branch name>
    > git push -u origin main
